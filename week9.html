Projection Based Augmented Reality
Projection Based Augmented RealityProjection based augmented reality works by projecting artificial light onto real world surfaces. Projection based augmented reality applications allow for human interaction by sending light onto a real world surface and then sensing the human interaction (i.e. touch) of that projected light. Detecting the user’s interaction is done by differentiating between an expected (or known) projection and the altered projection (caused by the user’s interaction). Another interesting application of projection based augmented reality utilizes laser plasma technology to project a three-dimensional (3D) interactive holograminto mid-air.

              <p class="bullet">Object recognition plays a vital role because the application cannot replace the original view with an augmented one if it cannot determine what the object is.</p>
