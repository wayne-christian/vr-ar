      <p>“Presence is a psychological state or subjective perception in which even though part of all of an individual’s current experience is generated by and or filtered through human-made technology, part of all of the individual’s perception fails to accurately acknowledge the role of the technology in the experience”</p>

      <h3>Immersion vs. Presence</h3>
      <p class="fragment tight bullet" style=""><strong>Immersion:</strong> describes the extent to which technology is capable of delivering a vivid illusion of reality to the senses
        of a human participant.</p>
      <p class="fragment tight bullet" style=""><strong>Presence:</strong> a state of consciousness, the (psychological) sense of being in the virtual environment.</p>
      <p class="fragment tight" style="">So Immersion, defined in technical terms, is capable of producing a sensation of Presence</p>
      <p class="fragment tiny">Slater, M., & Wilbur, S. (1997). A framework for immersive virtual environments (FIVE):Speculations on the role of presence in virtual environments. Presence: Teleoperators and virtual environments, 6(6), 603-616.</p>

      <h3>What is User Centered Design?</h3>
      <p>
User-centered design (UCD) is an iterative design process in which designers focus on the users and their needs in each phase of the design process. </p>
	<p>In UCD, design teams involve users throughout the design process via a variety of research and design techniques, to create highly usable and accessible products for them.</p>

		<p>Who is the target audience? (requirements elicitation)</p>
		<p>Who are the demographics?</p>
		<p>What kind of experience do you want to develop?</p>
		<p>"I think that looks nice" is to subjective</p>
		<p>We are designing & developing for people to have an enjoyable/educational/motivational and <strong>immersive</strong> experience</p>

		<strong>Physical Foundation</strong><br><br>
		Makes immersion possible in a virtual world by using technology that keeps the VR user safe from injury while wearing a headset;<br>
 comfortably free from soreness due to hardware ergonomics and <strong>free from motion sickness</strong>; and undistracted by unrelated sights and sounds leaking in from the outside world.</p>

<p class="third"><strong>Basic Realism</strong><br><br>
	Makes the virtual world seem real by providing smooth 3-D video, <strong>realistic sound</strong>, <strong>intuitive controls</strong> for manipulating the environment, and <strong>natural responses</strong> to the user’s actions in the virtual world.</p>

<p class="third"><strong>Beyond Novelty</strong><br><br>
	Keeps the <strong>immersion alive</strong> and engaging, rather than being merely impressive, by <strong>enabling interaction with nearly everything</strong> in the virtual world. It also offers good content or gameplay that’s independent of technology, making <strong>VR interactions</strong> core to the experience, and easing the user quickly and smoothly into the virtual world.</p>

	   <p>Respond faithfully to the user’s movements at all times, preferably at or near typical human locomotion speeds.</p>

      <h3>User Representation</h3>
      <p>The hardest factor in presence is user representation. To properly represent users, we need to know many things. Like, where are their legs, elbows, knees, etc... The technology now is limited to tracking hands. We can assume where the elbows and legs could be with inverse kinematics (Patricks talk on proprioception).

		  <p>No body is better than a wrong body. If users can see it, they expect to act the way their physical self would.</p>

		  <p>Problem: Hands can be tracked easily, but forearms are harder</p>
		  <p>Solution: Draw virtual hands, but leave forearms excluded</p>

		  <section>
			  <h3>Graphical Integrity</h3>
			  <p class="small">(fidelity & place illusion) Patricks map of knowledge)</p>
			  <p>While highly realistic graphics are desirable, consistency and smoothness of the graphics are even more important benchmarks than realism.</p>
 <p class="fragment">Imperfections such as heavy pixelation, tearing, or inconsistent levels of detail are all visual artefacts that will <strong>draw users out of the VR world</strong>.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section data-background-video="assets/character.mp4" data-background-video-loop="loop">
		  <p>Increased graphical clarity of human characters or the players’ avatars has diminishing returns because of the “uncanny valley.”</p>

		  <p></p>
	  </section>
	  <section data-background="assets/arm-hud-widget2.gif">
		  <h3>Intuitive Controls</h3>
“Better-than-real” interactions
It should be easy to do things like select, grasp, manipulate, carry, throw, and place objects or other environmental features. The level of interaction does not always need to be completely realistic, as going too far can have the effect of making small tasks very tedious and difficult.(unless a specific training tool)
	  </section>
	  <section>
		  <h3>Ubiquitous Interactivity</h3>
		   <p class="small">(interaction fidelity, plausibility, usability)</p>
		  <p>
			  In a VR environment, users assume that everything is there for a purpose and, therefore, expect to interact with everything around them. In 2-D PC video games it’s common to have some objects be “live” and interactive while others are static and can’t be touched or moved. Developers may assume the same is true of VR games, but it is not.</p>

	  <p>Ubiquitous Interactivity</p>
	  </section>
	  <section data-background-video="assets/tutorial.mp4" data-background-video-loop="loop">

		  <h3>Agency to interact</h3>
		  <p class="small">(interaction fidelity, plausibility, usability)</p>
		  <p><span class="dark-back">
			  Studies with end users have shown that the heightened reality of a VR environment leads them to expect to touch, pick up, or examine the objects around them for the simple reason that everything seems real. Users rapidly come to expect that their agency (their ability to choose what to interact with and how to do so) will be respected</span></p>
	  </section>
    
   
     
     <section>
		 <h3>Smooth Onboarding</h3>
     Because a virtual world is at the same time very different from the real world but nearly as believable, many of the most successful VR titles take steps to smoothly transition to the virtual world.
	  </section>
   
     
     <section data-background-video="assets/fade.mp4" data-background-video-loop="loop">

Gentle but rapid transitions reduce the shock of entering a new environment, software can help the user transition gradually to the virtual world and keep immersion.
	  </section>
	  <section>
		<h3>Forced Behaviours</h3>
		<p>Moving a player involuntarily:</p>
		<p>Breaks presence (Loses autonomy)</p>
		<p>Causes motion sickness (Breaks Presence)</p>
		</section>
     <section data-background-video="assets/lost.mp4" data-background-video-loop="loop">
		 <h3>Attention</h3>
<p>Users should have freedom to look anywhere (lose of autonomy breaks immersion), so capturing and guiding attention is important</p>
		 <p>Audio and visual cues can help nudge users in the right way</p>
		 <p>Forced Attention = BAD EXPERIENCE (Loses autonomy)</p>
		</section>
    
     <section>
		<h3>Frame Rate is King</h3>
		 <p>Reduce Polys</p>
		 <p>Bake Textures</p>
		 <p>Leverage Unity</p>
		 <p>Slow fram rates break Presence (Patricks Slides)</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Virtual reality’s improving capabilities can create a remarkably convincing sense of immersion.</p>
      <p class="bullet">
		  User is immediately a part of the environment you’ve built</p>
		 <p class="bullet">Small details matter</p>
		 <p class="bullet">360 degree content is expected</p>
		 <p class="bullet">Users will want to try their own ideas</p>
<p class="bullet">Great VR experiences react the way a user expects, even if it isn’t part of the
	designed flow</p>
		 <p class="bullet">Even small places can be open for exploration</p>
<p class="bullet">Scale makes a huge impact on presence</p>
