      <h3>NO MORES LAW ON OPTICS</h3>
      <p class="small">Everyone, it seems, starts with Ray-Ban® sunglasses as their starting point. As they try and solve one technical problem after another, the headset grows until it becomes a small helmet, ala Hololens (1 and 2). <br><br>
Even if they use something that looks thin like waveguides, the waveguides have to be protected as they are very fragile. Adding SLAM means having to put cameras that are spread out and have to be mounted somewhere, which makes the headset bigger. <br>
<br>
Supporting transparency while being bright enough to see the image, requires a bright projector, which in turn means battery power and heat management.</p>

      <h3>Spatial mapping</h3>
      <p>The current state of technology allows us to create an environment mesh almost instantaneously as the depth sensing camera captures the environment. But this can have limitations.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>You first have to really explore your area to let the device map your playground. If you’re using HoloLens, you’d have to make sure that you approach and look at all objects within 3.1 meters in front of you. If you don’t, the camera won’t capture all details that you want to interact with</p>
      <p>Busy areas with people can create "ghosting" when mapping.</p>
